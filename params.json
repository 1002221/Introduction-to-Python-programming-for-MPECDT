{"name":"Introduction to programming for geoscientists","tagline":"Based on the text book \"A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python\" by Hans Petter Langtangen.","body":"##Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is a 1st year undergraduate course for geoscientists. The course has two objectives:\r\n* Learn the basic principles of computer programming. This understanding will form the basis for learning many other programming languages.\r\n* Become proficient at Python programming as it is currently one of the most commonly used languages in computational science.\r\n\r\nHere you will find the lecture notes in [Ipython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) format.\r\n\r\n* [Lecture 0 (Introduction)](https://raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-0-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 1 (Introduction)](https://raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 2 (Introduction)](https://raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-2-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 3 (Introduction)](https://raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-3-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 4 (Introduction)](https://raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-4-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 5 (Introduction)](https://raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-5-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 6 (Introduction)](https://raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-6-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)","google":"UA-44566485-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
