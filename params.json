{"name":"Introduction to programming for geoscientists","tagline":"Based on the text book \"A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python\" by Hans Petter Langtangen.","body":"##Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is a 1st year undergraduate course for geoscientists. The course has two objectives:\r\n* Learn the basic principles of computer programming. This understanding will form the basis for learning many other programming languages.\r\n* Become proficient at Python programming as it is currently one of the most commonly used languages in computational science.\r\n\r\nThe lectures notes are written in [Ipython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) format. To view individual lectures you can simple click on the links below. However, you should download the zip file containing all the lectures and data files if you want to edit them or execute the python code embedded in the lectures.\r\n\r\n* [Lecture 0 (Introduction)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-0-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 1 (Introduction)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 2 (Introduction)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-2-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 3 (Introduction)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-3-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 4 (Introduction)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-4-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 5 (Introduction)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-5-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 6 (Introduction)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-6-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)","google":"UA-44566485-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
