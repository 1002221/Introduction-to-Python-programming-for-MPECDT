{"name":"Introduction to programming for geoscientists","tagline":"Based on the text book \"A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python\" by Hans Petter Langtangen.","body":"##Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is a 1st year undergraduate course for geoscientists taught by [Gerard Gorman](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.gorman) at [Imperial College London](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/earthscienceandengineering). The course has two objectives:\r\n* Learn the basic principles of computer programming. This understanding will form the basis for learning many other programming languages.\r\n* Become proficient at Python programming as it is currently one of the most commonly used languages in computational science.\r\n\r\nThe lectures notes are written in [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) format. To take a quick view of the individual lectures you can simple click on the links below (uses the online tool [http://nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org)).\r\n\r\nYou can use Python/IPython on a wide range of computing platforms including Windows, Linux and Mac. If you have your own laptop that you want to use then ask for assistance in the lecture to get everything setup. \r\n\r\nIn the lecture we are going to run everything off the dept student linux servers - student.ese.ic.ac.uk and student2.ese.ic.ac.uk. In the first lecture you will be shown how to *ssh* to this server. Once you are logged in you will want to get a copy of the lecture material. To do this you execute the following command at the terminal:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.git\r\n\r\nIf you type *ls* you will see that this has created a directory *Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/*. Navigate to the directory containing the course material using the command:\r\n\r\n    cd Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/notebook\r\n\r\nThe lecture material will be updated throughout the term to add exercises and sample solutions to previous weeks. So you should *pull* updates regularly by navigating to that directory and issuing the command:\r\n\r\n    git pull\r\n\r\n To get started with ipython notebook issue the following command:\r\n\r\n    ipython notebook\r\n\r\n*google-chrome* should start up and you should see the list of lectures. Start by clicking on lecture 0.\r\n\r\n* [Lecture 0 (Introduction)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-0-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true) [Exercises](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists-Exercises.ipynb?raw=true) [Solutions](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists-Solutions.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 2](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-2-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true) [Exercises](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-2-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists-Exercises.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 3](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-3-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 4](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-4-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 5](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-5-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n* [Lecture 6](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-6-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)","google":"UA-44566485-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
