Welcome to this introductory programming course for geoscientists. Here you
will find a series of lectures focused on learning to program using
<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. So that we can purely focus on learning to
program we will be using <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython Notebook</a>
which is a friendly "web-based interactive computational environment where you
can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a
single document". This avoids us getting bogged down in details of using the
command line in Linux, Windows or Mac for now (don't worry - we will deal with
this next term).<br>

The full lecture series can be accessed <a href="lecture_series">here</a> if you are
revising or want to forge ahead. Otherwise follow the series of posts below
each week as we make our way through the material.
