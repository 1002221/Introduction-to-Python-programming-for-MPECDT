The lecture is written in IPython notebook format. You can view it directly using
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)
or [download the notebook here](http://raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true)

We recommend that you download the notebooks for the lecture and store them in the H: drive. You will quickly see that you can edit these notebooks yourself to add your own notes and do the exercises. When you download the notebook file you can open it in a number of ways in the computer lab. Both of these solutions will also work on your personal computer and you can download the packages for free.

### [Enthought: Conopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/)
Go to the Windows Start menu and start Canopy. From Canopy open the notebook that you downloaded.

### [Continuum Analytics - Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)
First, we strongly recommend setting your default browser to Google Chrome or Firefox. However, Internet Explorer will not work. From the Windows Start menu, open the `cmd` command line tool and type:
{% highlight bash %}
ipython notebook
{% endhighlight %}
Then press Enter. This will start up IPython Notebook in your default browser. From there you can open the IPython Notebook file that you have downloaded.
