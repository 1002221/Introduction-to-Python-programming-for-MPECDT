The initial lectures are in iPython notebook format. To get started,
you need to clone the git repository for this course. Open up a
terminal on your laptop.

Let's create a directory (folder) in which to keep the code we're
going to work on. You'll also keep more code in here during the core
modules, and during your project work if you work on a computational
project. The traditional name for a source code directory in the Linux
world is `src`, so we type:

```
mkdir src
```

This means "make a directory called `src`.

`help`

```
git clone https://github.com/mpecdt/Introduction-to-Python-programming-for-MPECDT.git
```

if you have set up ssh access to GitHub, you could insead type:

```
git clone git@github.com:mpecdt/Introduction-to-Python-programming-for-MPECDT.git
```

Let's have a look at what we've done. To list the files in the current directory (folder), we type:

```
ls
```
