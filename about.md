This course is based on a Python programming course created by
[Gerard Gorman](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.gorman) and
[Christian Jacobs](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/c.jacobs10) in the
Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College
London. The course follows
[Hans Petter Langtangen's](http://hplgit.github.io/homepage/index.html)
book
[A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-30293-0),
which may be downloaded free by machines connected to the Imperial
network. Many chapters of the most recent edition are freely
accessible
[online](http://hplgit.github.io/primer.html/doc/web/index.html).

<!--
The course has two objectives:

* To ensure that 

Learn the basic principles of computer programming. [Python](https://www.python.org/) is currently one of the [most popular introductary teaching languages](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext) and is an excellent gateway to learning other computing languages that you may encounter as your career develops.
* Become proficient and productive in Python. It is heavily used in geoscience and you will encounter it many times during your studies, particularly in project work.
-->

The lecture notes are written in [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). This is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document.
